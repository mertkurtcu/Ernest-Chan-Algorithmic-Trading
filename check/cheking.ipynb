    "# Statistical Mean Reversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean reversion is a trading strategy positing that asset prices and returns tend to revert to their long-term mean or average level over time. Mathematically, such a continuous-time series is represented by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the change in price series in the next period is proportional to the difference between the mean price and the current price. In contrast, a random walk, or Brownian motion, where current price movements are independent of historical data, lacks the \"memory\" of its previous states at any given moment in time. The mean-reverting characteristic of such time series can be leveraged to design and implement profitable trading strategies."

    "# Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical test used to determine whether a given time series is stationary or not. A stationary time series has properties that do not depend on the time at which the series is observed; specifically, its mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure remain constant over time. The ADF test is used to test for the presence of a unit root.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic Dickey-Fuller test can be represented by the following autoregressive model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_t = \\rho y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y_t$ is the time series observation,\n",
    "- $\\epsilon_t$ is the white noise error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for higher-order autoregressive processes and improve the test's robustness, the ADF test uses an augmented model that includes lagged differences of $y_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\rho y_{t-1} + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i \\Delta y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$ is the first difference of $y_t$,\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the constant term,\n",
    "- $\\beta t$ represents the trend term (optional),\n",
    "- $\\rho$ is the coefficient on the lagged level of the time series,\n",
    "- $\\phi_i$ are coefficients for the lagged differences,\n",
    "- $p$ is the number of lagged differences included,\n",
    "- $\\epsilon_t$ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: $\\rho = 0$. This implies that the time series has a unit root and is non-stationary.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: $\\rho < 0$. This implies that the time series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic for the ADF test is derived from the estimated value of $\\rho$. Specifically, we estimate the model and obtain the coefficient $\\hat{\\rho}$ on $y_{t-1}$. The test statistic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{ADF Statistic} = \\frac{\\hat{\\rho} - 1}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho})$ is the standard error of the $\\hat{\\rho}$ estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculated ADF statistic is compared to critical values from the Dickey-Fuller distribution. These critical values vary depending on whether the model includes a constant, a trend, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If the ADF statistic is less than the critical value**: Reject the null hypothesis $H_0$, suggesting the time series is stationary.\n",
    "- **If the ADF statistic is greater than the critical value**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$, suggesting the time series is non-stationary."
